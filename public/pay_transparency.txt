The following table is how much I've made from each job I've undertaken over these
past few years, as well as a brief blurb about each of my employers, and why I left.

Pay transparency is something that is very near-and-dear to me. I have seen pay discrimination firsthand, 
and I personally believe that financial transparency is one of those ways that we can prevent those who pay us 
from having unjust power over us. And, personally, as a POC trans woman, I *have* been the subject of pay discrimination
and indiscriminate downleveling for 'business reasons'. And, personally, when I was first starting my career,
I had no idea whatsoever on how much I should truly value my time or services at, which led me to being grossly underpaid for
large portions of my career. By releasing this information to the public, I hope this helps you, the reader, to make an informed decision 
on how much you should ask for :)

Thanks, Xe!

Regarding being "terminated for cause" at Paradoxum Games, I was supposedly terminated for having 'misappropriated' company funds. How did I misappropriate these company funds, you may ask? See, I had donated
approximately $3,000 USD of company funds to an open-source developer creating software that we depended on in the regular course of conducting business. This was considered by the CEO to be a "misappropriation", 
for which I was terminated for cause. In other words, they were just waiting for me to fuck up so they could get rid of me. Anyways, the CEO was a real asshole, and I don't recommend anyone works there.
